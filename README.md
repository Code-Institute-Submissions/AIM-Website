# AIM | Always In Motion Website

There are millions of people today that are in some form of dance class or acting class. The performing arts indusrty is in that way huge attracting big crowds. In the christian world I've noticed there is an interest in the performing arts, however many churches don't have the knowledge or the possibility to offer these services to their young people or congregation. In this project I've created a website that provides performing arts services such as dancing and drama in forms of workshops catered to the specific needs of different churches and organisations. 
 
## UX
 
This website aims to target churches and youth organisations interested in dance and the performing arts. I have focused a lot on the visual aspect and was striving for a clean and minimalist design allowing an ease of use for potential customers to easily navigate and make use of the website. In the first stage of my UX process I familiarized myself with Balsamiq wireframe which allowed me to sketch a visual on what design would be most effective for the purpose of my website and its users.  

User stories:
- I found the website fairly easy to manoeuvre. I liked the visual experience that it gave but at times found it a bit hard to read the text. There is definitely room for improvement but I think it was a good effort.

Wireframes:
- Desktop version <a href="../wireframes/desktop">Click here</a>
- Mobile version <a href="../wireframes/mobile">Click here</a>

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

### Existing Features
- Eye-catching image of dancer with the brand name displayed 
- Colorful background that scrolls with the user 
- Video - allows users to get a visual experience of what the ministry/company has to offer and how a potential workshop could look like. 
- Links to social media in the footer to allow users to keep up to date on what projects are on.
- Contact link - allows users to get directed to contact page easily. 
- Contact form - allows users to send enquiries to company/ministry. 

### Features Left to Implement
- In the future I would like to add a recommendations carousel as well as add more videos and images.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies have been used in the project.

1. Balsamiq Wireframe (https://balsamiq.com/)
    - Used at the beginning of the project to develop the right UX design desired for mobile and desktop resolutions.
2. HTML (https://html.com/)
    - used to modify and add structure from bootstrap.
3. CSS (https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/)
    - used to style the website to suite my own personal style.
4. Bootstrap v.4.5.2 (https://getbootstrap.com/) 
    - used to build the main frame and structure for all pages with a mobile first approach and desktop view, including the carousel feature.
5. Fontawesome (https://fontawesome.com/)
    - used for all the icons.
6. Googlefonts (https://fonts.google.com/)
    - used for the fonts of all pages.
7. GitHub (https://github.com/)
    - I uploaded my projects on a regular basis on github and also used it as a source of information and tool to learn even how to write this ReadMe.
8. Google and youtube (https://google.com) (https://youtube.com)
    - Used when I was stuck and needed some help in developing my project.

## Testing

I have made sure that the testing was done to the best of my ability. 

#Code checking

I have checked and worked on all the necessary corrections to make sure all my pages where CSS3 And HTML5 approved, I had 1 error on HTML5 but none on CSS3. 

#Web browsers

I have run my project on Firefox and Google chrome and found no issues on desktop view. The ipad view is ok as well but could improve on the margins. 

In the mobile view I have some issues on the main page where the text gets all jumbled towards the bottom of the page. I didn't manage to fix it as of yet as other code got messed up when I tried. The mobile view in general could be improved as I would've liked to implement my video as well as the picture but was unable to do so due to the file sizes. The main page however is definitely in need of improvement.

## Deployment

I choose to deploy this project on GitHub Pages, below are the steps I used to deploy.

- Logged into my github profile page and clicked on my project's name,
- Clicked on settings,
- Scrolled down the page to GitHub Pages,
- Under Source, selected master branch and My First Milestone Project - AIM Website is published!
